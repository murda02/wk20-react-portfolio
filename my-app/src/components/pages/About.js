                For the past 10+ years I have worked as a QA Engineer testing software for several different companies. I currently work for Plus One Robotics and test the vision system for robotic arms. Over the years I have taught myself how to write automated tests in order test software. I'm taking a codeing bootcasmp at DU in order to better understand the code that I test, to write better automated tests and possibly jump ship and become a developer.
